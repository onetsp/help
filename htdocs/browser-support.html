    <h1>Which web browser (or mobile phone browser) can I use with One tsp.?</h1>
</div>

<div class="span12">

    <p>One tsp. is tested regularly in latest releases of Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome, and on the iPhone's mobile Safari browser. The site is occasionally tested in Internet Explorer.  It's recommended that you use one of these browsers for the best experience.</p>
    <p>If you're not using one of the recommended browsers, some features may not work properly or may look a little funky.  If you experience very flaky behavior, feel free to <a href="http://onetsp.com/support">report problems</a>, especially for phone browsers (BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone, etc.).</p>
    <p><strong>We do not officially support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.</strong>  If you are having trouble with One tsp. and are using an older version of Internet Explorer, we recommend that you <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">upgrade your browser</a>.</p>
