        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> All recipes you save on One tsp. are private. No other visitors to the site will be able to see recipes you have collected, even if they have a user account of their own.</p>
        <p>If you decide, however, to share a recipe with a friend using the "<a href="how-to-share-recipes.html">email to a friend</a>" option, the recipient will have a copy of the recipe for their own use. We do not restrict what they might do with it.</p>
