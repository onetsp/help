        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> You can download a zip file containing all of your recipes. These files can be used for viewing your recipes offline or for importing them into other databases or another web site.  One tsp. uses a custom format for recipe storage, so importing to other web sites may require some technical skills on your end.</p>
        <p><i>NOTE: recipe photos are currently not included with exports.</i></p>
        <p>More information about downloading your recipes can be found on your <a href="http://onetsp.com/account/home">Account Page</a>.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to <a href="http://onetsp.com/contact">contact us</a> with questions about other download formats.</p>
