    <h1>Is there an iPhone App?</h1>

    <p><b>No.</b> Unfortunately, there is not a native iPhone app for One tsp. You will not find it in the iTunes App Store.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="iphone-install.html" title="Install recipe manager on iPhone">create an icon on your home screen</a> for One tsp. that will make it look very much like a native iPhone app.</p>

    <p>Mobile access to your recipes is a core philosophy behind One tsp. It's why I created the app in the first place. So there is a very good mobile web interface for One tsp. that has <i>nearly</i> all of the features of the standard version of One tsp. you find on a desktop web browser.</p>
    <p>To access One tsp. on your iPhone, Android, or other smart phone, open your phone's web browser and enter the address: <a href="http://onetsp.com/">http://onetsp.com</a>.</p>
