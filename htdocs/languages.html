    <h1>Can I write recipes in a language other than English?</h1>
</div>

<div class="span12">

    <p>One tsp. supports non-English recipes...<em>mostly</em>.  What I would say is that you should try it out, and if you run into problems, <a href="http://onetsp.com/support">send an email</a> and I'll see what I can do to fix things.  I'm not, however, testing the site rigorously in other languages.  So any help you want to provide is greatly appreciated!</p>
