    <h1>How do I share my recipes on One tsp.?</h1>
</div>

<div class="span12">

    <p>One tsp. is designed for storing your own private collection of recipes. Recipes you add to One tsp. cannot be viewed by other One tsp. users.</p>
    <p>You can share recipes by email with people you know. Every recipe page has an "email to a friend" link. A copy of the recipe will be delivered to your friend's email account. If they also have a One tsp. account, they will have the option to copy the recipe directly into their account.</p>
